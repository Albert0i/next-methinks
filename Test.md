### Relative image path

![alt relative ](img/building.JPG)

if you see the above image, that means *reBaseImageUrl* works as expected. 


### Absolute image path 

![alt absolute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Albert0i/next-methinks/main/img/building.JPG)

if you can't see the above image, that means *reBaseImageUrl* doesn't work and try changing *_rebaseimg=false*.
