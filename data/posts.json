As a matter of fact, we don't even realize what is \"soul\". \n\nAssuming that body, which is a palpable and perceivable existence, has a invisible connexion with soul. If it is true. Is it possible to *disentangle* them? Or connect the soul with another body? Then what is the **identity** of man? By soul? By body? Or by both? \n\nDoes the soul eat? Does the soul feel? Does the soul sleep? We definitely not know. \n",
